	{"code":"tutorial3-a","text":"Welcome back. Before we get started on something new, let's have a quick recap.\n\n&TITLE>Recap&W>\n\nBy now, hopefully you're starting to get a feel for what Big Pharma is about. In broad strokes: it's about bringing ingredients into your factory and using machines to alter concentrations and upgrade cures to increase the value of them. Then hopefully sell them for a profit.\n\nThe main limit to the cures you can produce are the ingredients you have available and the machines you've unlocked.\n\nThis tutorial will teach you how you can invest your hard earned cash into discovering new ingredients and researching new machines.\n\n&TITLE>Exploring&W>\n\nNavigate to the &LTBLUE>Ingredients Tab&W>."},

	{"code":"tutorial3-b","text":"This is an undiscovered ingredient. The little icon and the x1 tell us that we need to send 1 &LTBLUE>Explorer&W> to the location to discover it. Let's do that.\n\nHire an explorer using the hire button towards the top right of the screen."},

	{"code":"tutorial3-c","text":"Notice the indicator underneath changes."},

	{"code":"tutorial3-d","text":"This tells us the number of &LTBLUE>Idle Explorers&W> we currently have, plus the number of &LTBLUE>Ingredient Upgrade Points&W> we have. These are earned by your idle explorers and can be used to decrease the cost of ingredients. They are disabled in this tutorial to keep things simple but will be explained in more detail in a later tutorial.\n\nAssign your &LTBLUE>Explorer&W> to the &LTBLUE>Dragon Beetle&W> ingredient by clicking on the box."},

	{"code":"tutorial3-e","text":"The percentage tells us how long until the ingredient is discovered. In this tutorial the exploration speed is at 5x to ensure you're not hanging around too much. But in a real scenario it would take much longer.\n\n&TITLE>Researching&W>\n\nNavigate to the &LTBLUE>Research Tab&W> using the button at the bottom of the screen.\n\nThe &LTBLUE>Research Tab&W> is where you hire &LTBLUE>Scientists&W> and assign them to new research projects. Each research project yields something different. Some unlock machines, some open up new ingredient types, others simply allow you to reach new research projects.\n\nTo complete this tutorial, you need access to a new machine called the &LTBLUE>Ioniser&W>. Hire a Scientist and assign it to this project."},

	{"code":"tutorial3-f","text":"&LTBLUE>Idle Scientist&W>s also earn you &LTBLUE>Upgrade Points&W>. Again they are disabled in this tutorial but will be explained in a later one.\n\n&TITLE>Improving Efficiency&W>\n\nNavigate back to the &LTBLUE>Production Tab&W>.\n\nWhile we wait for our new ingredient and research project to complete we should make some improvements to our existing production lines.\n\nDid you notice that your &LTBLUE>Pill Printers&W> takes longer to process drugs than your &LTBLUE>Evaporators&W>? It's true! Look at how the drugs back up when they reach the entrance to the &LTBLUE>Pill Printer&W>.\n\nWe can optimise this inefficiency by splitting our production line across 2 &LTBLUE>Pill Printers&W>."},

	{"code":"tutorial3-g","text":"You can accomplish this by building a second &LTBLUE>Pill Printer&W> next to the first, and then using the &LTBLUE>Belt&W> tool add &LTBLUE>T-Junctions&W> to your belts.\n\nAdd a &LTBLUE>T-Junction&W> by:&LIST>\n - Selecting the Belt tool from the menu on the left.\n - Hovering over an existing belt that you want to junction from.\n - Click and drag out from the existing belt in the direction you want to split towards.&W>\n\nYou'll notice that your production line now moves along every day, splitting the drugs across the two &LTBLUE>Pill Printers&W> to ensure no more backing up.\n\nYou can use this technique with other machines too, not just the &LTBLUE>Pill Printer&W>. But I'll let you figure that one out for yourself.\n\nWhen your ingredient is discovered and your research complete, messages will appear in the top left of the screen. Check back here regularly to keep on top of what is happening in your business.\n\nMove on to the next part of the tutorial once your ingredient is discovered and your research is complete. Remember you can speed up time using the time controls in the bottom left of the screen.\n\n&TITLE>Using your new tools&W>\n\nNavigate to the &LTBLUE>Ingredients Tab&W>.\n\nYour new ingredient contains a &eff0>Relieves Hypertension&W> cure. To make some extra money though, we are going to upgrade it to a &eff1>Treats Angina&W> cure.\n\nImport your new ingredient into one of the empty sockets in your factory and design a production line which will upgrade it.\n\nTips:&LIST>\n - You'll need to expand your factory again to make space for your new line\n - Remember to hover over the &eff0>Relieves Hypertension&LIST> effect to find out how to upgrade it.\n - First you need to get the ingredient to the specified upgrade concentration (0-6).\n - You'll notice that this time we need to decrease the concentration rather than increase it. You can use &LTBLUE>Dissolvers&LIST> to accomplish this.\n - Once you reach the required upgrade concentration, you'll need to upgrade the cure using one of your newly researched &LTBLUE>Ionisers&LIST>.\n - Remember you can click on your machines and drugs to check how things are getting on and adjust if necessary.\n - Once upgraded, you'll need to adjust the concentration again to activate the &eff1>Treats Angina&LIST> cure.\n - Hover over the &eff1>Treats Angina&LIST> concentration bar to find out the &LTBLUE>Active Concentration Region&LIST>.\n - Once you manage to activate it, you'll need to use a &LTBLUE>Pill Printer&LIST> to turn your drug into a finished product which you can sell.&W>\n\nPhew, how did you do? Don't worry if you got confused. Take a look at the layout below and see how yours compares."},

	{"code":"tutorial3-h","text":"If necessary you can adjust your production line so it uses the same layout, but make sure you understand how it works because from here there'll be no more hand holding!\n\nThe tutorial will complete when you have named and sold a single unit of your new drug.

This has an extra requirement that we've not seen before, called a &LTBLUE>Catalyst&W>. Before this upgrade reaction can go off, we need to get a special &effbad>Side-Effect&W> into our drug which will catalyse this reaction.\n\nLet's go find our &LTBLUE>Catalyst&W>.

Select it and watch what happens when we try to add these two ingredients together. You'll notice that the &eff1>Alleviates Insomnia&W> effect is discarded.\n\nThis is because the &LTBLUE>Multimixer&W> simply cannot mix two effects occupying the same slot.

People don't like it when their medication makes them feel nauseated.\n\n&LTBLUE>Cure Ratings&W> depend on the how good a drug is at curing whatever ailment it is aimed at, as well as the frequency with which it causes side-effects. Both of these things depend on the &LTBLUE>Strength&W> of the cure or side-effect within the product. This &LTBLUE>Strength&W> varies depending on the concentration of the drug. We'll learn more about this in the next section.\n\nThe &LTBLUE>Cure Ratings&W> are broken down into bands ranging from S+ all the way down to F. The average rating is C. If a product has a rating higher than this then it will get a bonus to its value. If a product has a rating lower than this then it will get a negative modifier to its value.\n\nNext we're going to learn about a machine which allows us to improve the &LTBLUE>Cure Ratings&W> of our products.\n\n&TITLE>The Analyzer Machine&W>\n\nIn the last section you were introduced to the concept of an effect &LTBLUE>Strength&W> which determines the &LTBLUE>Cure Rating&W> of your products.

Creating a more effective drug, or one with a higher &LTBLUE>Cure Rating&W> will not always result in a more profitable drug.
